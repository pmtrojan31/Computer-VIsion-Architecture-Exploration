## U_NET vs SAM for Segmentation
U-Net (imported from segmentation_models_pytorch) and Meta AIâ€™s SAM (Segment Anything Model) were trained on the Carvana dataset (with synthetic samples for demo). Both models were trained / evaluated and their segmentation accuracy was compared using metrics like Dice Score, precision, recall and f1 score.
